            <p>As I ran the Boston Marathon in 2013, I visualized the finish line. Mile 17 was especially hard for me, and I felt my body hit what is popularly known as “the wall”: 
                a feeling of complete exhaustion usually reached somewhere around mile 20, caused
                by depleted glycogen stores in your body. Limbs feel leaden, every step feels harder than the last, and your mind reels with the fact that 
                you aren&apos;t done yet.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>The mental component of the wall is as real as the chemical one, and breaking through it requires incredible determination. 
                Runners speak about the wall with an air of mythical surety and communal empathy, because everyone knows what it feels like but no one can accurately predict when or if it will happen. 
                The Boston Marathon carries an extra difficulty—between miles 17 and 21, the point of the marathon where runners often hit the wall, the course meets a series of hills, each longer than the last. 
                The final one, Heartbreak Hill, is enshrined in marathon lore for its psychological and physical difficulty, not because of its size but because of its placement on the course. 
                I crested the infamous summit at mile 21, breaking through the wall, and began my descent into Boston, weary but determined, monomaniacal in my goal to finish.</p>    
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>In retrospect, I should have known something was wrong. Around mile 23, ambulances started screaming past the runners still on the course, and people were crying around me. But it was my first marathon; 
                I had cried in mile 17, and people probably needed medical assistance at the finish line, I thought, because marathons are hard on your body. So I and thousands of others kept running towards the finish line, unaware.</p>

            <p>At mile 25, my parents ran up to me, tears in their eyes, relieved to have found me. I felt delusional when I saw them there, instead of at the finish line. “There&apos;s been an explosion,” they said. 
                “It&apos;s bad. You can&apos;t finish.”</p>
            <p>It took hours for me to understand what had happened, and even now, years later, I&apos;m still struggling with it. After 25 miles, my brain wasn&apos;t quite working, and my body didn&apos;t quite understand why the race had stopped. 
                My heart was broken.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>The explosions that year irrevocably colored running for me. I barely ran for six months, and then reluctantly began training for Boston 2014. I had to finish the race. I raised another $5,000 for the same charity, and I went through the same mileage. </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>On a beautiful, unseasonably warm day, I finally got my “Boylston Street Moment,” the last half-mile of the Boston Marathon course. Runners turn onto Boylston Street and find thousands of people waiting, even five or six hours after the elite athletes start and finish their races, cheering for you, celebrating with you.
                The 2014 race defied the tragedy of the year before and proved that the human spirit is, against all odds, indefatigable. The ancient Greeks used to run athletic races and games at funerals as a way to mourn losses while reaffirming life.
                The 2014 Boston Marathon felt a bit like that, a reverent homage to the loss of the year before combined with a cathartic celebration of the fact that yes, we can still run, and yes, we will.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>The slogan “Boston Strong” covered the course, an emblematic reminder that the marathon is a triumph over all hurt. 
                I finished the race, collected my medal, and hobbled to dinner with my family, relieved and proud.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>But running one marathon is simply a sip of water for an insatiable thirst. The logo of the BAA, which appears on every finisher&apos;s medal, is a unicorn, an elusive, mythical creature that has long been sought after and imagined but never quite captured, much like the pursuit of the marathon itself. So I decided to run Boston again in 2015, 
                this time for WalkBoston, a charity dedicated to pedestrian safety and accessibility. In 2015, Marathon Monday was pouring rain, and as we bussed out to Hopkinton, the threat of rain and a headwind terrified us all. Having trained through the worst Boston winter on record, we were sturdy runners, but no one wants to run a marathon in those conditions.</p>
            <p>But 26.2 miles later, I crossed the finish line again, in a baptismal downpour, witnessing even in horrible weather the celebration that accompanies a marathon. Craig Rodgers says the best part of the marathon is the spectators; they complete the experience, they make it something other than a long run. And it&apos;s true. 
                As you high-five children along the course, and as thousands of people you&apos;ve never met cheer you across the finish line, you feel part of a human family far greater than your own.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>Running has a healing power, a connecting power. Even in ancient Greece, the original marathon runner Pheidippides was running for a purpose, sharing a message of victory on the battlefield, uniting people miles apart from each other. Running is humbling in its power to join, in its power to prove with each step the staggering burden that we all share.</p>
            <p>Since freshman year I&apos;ve had this quote taped on my wall:</p>
        </div>
        <div id="posterquote">
            <p><b>THE LONGTIME RUNNER HAS<br>NEGOTIATED A COMPLICATED<br>RELATIONSHIP WITH PAIN—WHAT IT<br>IS
                IS AND WHAT IT ISN&apos;T, WHAT IT DOES<br>AND DOESN&apos;T DO. ...HE THINKS ABOUT<br>
                COMFORT AS A STEADY-STATE THAT<br>BRINGS NOTHING TO THE PARTY AND<br>
                EATS ALL THE CHEETOS. COMFORT IS<br>COASTING, AND ALL COASTING LEADS<br>
                TO STILLNESS, AND <span class="highlightphrase">HE DOESN&apos;T WANT<br>STILLNESS,</span> THIS FRIEND OF MINE.</b></p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>Running any distance at any speed fights stillness and monotony, and it hurts. You are pursuing the impossible, going after the great white whale, searching for the unicorn. Running is proving that you are more than your body, that you can overcome hurt and loss. In your lungs, legs, and heart, you have the most incredible capacity to breathe deep and go, 
                to challenge this body and this life, to tap into a higher reality that ignores the limits you otherwise have to obey. You can go farther and longer than you ever realized, just putting one foot in front of the other, 
                if you&apos;re willing to be humbled by the pain without sinking into it. In striving, you are a runner, so rejoice—you have won.</p>
