    <h1>Running is Political</h1>
    <h5>Das Z Letter</h5>
    <div>
        <p>Political decisions and even the tone and culture of debate have consequences 
            that reach into <b>every</b> aspect of society - including the world of sports.</p>
        <p>Running may seem disconnected from such debates, but it is not. 
            The values we uphold in our running communities reflect the values we uphold 
            in the wider world. Inevitably, however, someone will chime in with the 
            all-too-familiar phrase: <em>"Keep politics out of running!"</em></p>
        <p><b>Let's be clear:</b></p>
        <p><em>Running is political.</em></p>

        <p>Why Running Is Political</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>Running is an activity that brings people together, builds communities, 
            and shapes culture. It is where social behavior is claimed and negotiated. 
            Runners are not just individuals tracking their pace or debating the best 
            cushioning technology. They are consumers, employees, crew captains, social 
            media role models, coaches, business owners, competitors, and teammates. 
            Each of these roles is intertwined with decisions and actions that shape the 
            social fabric of our sport - and our society.</p>
        <p>Also, simply ignoring politics in running is a privilege that many do not have.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Who can run freely in public spaces without being verbally or physically attacked?</li>
            <li>Who has access to safe running facilities?</li>
            <li>Who feels welcome at races, in running crews, in sports clubs?</li>
            <li>Who is judged at the starting line because they don't have the money for the 
                latest shoes and the best equipment?</li>
            <li>Who is treated differently in running communities because of their gender, 
                what they look like, or where they come from?</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>SPECIAL EFFECT: <br>These are inherently political questions. Pretending otherwise 
            is not neutrality - it is a choice to ignore the structures that create inclusion 
            for some and exclusion for others.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>Why This is a Good Thing</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>Yes, I believe that the running community has the potential to be a powerful force 
            for positive change. A space where meaningful debate opens hearts and minds. Where 
            solidarity extends beyond the high five after a run, and where peaceful coexistence 
            of different backgrounds, beliefs, and identities is practiced every day. Running 
            together makes a statement. It proves that diversity is not a threat, but a strength.</p>

        <p>Now, more than ever, is the time to be loud and visible. To open this space for 
            debate and exchange. Silence is death.</p>
            
        <p>So speak your mind. State your values. Stand up to injustice whenever and 
            wherever you see it. And never let anyone tell you that there is no place 
            for political discourse in running. There is.</p>
