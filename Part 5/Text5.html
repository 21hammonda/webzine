    <div>
        <p>Political decisions and even the tone and culture of debate have consequences 
            that reach into <b>every</b> aspect of society - including the world of sports.</p>
        <p>Running may seem disconnected from such debates, but it is not. 
            The values we uphold in our running communities reflect the values we uphold 
            in the wider world. Inevitably, however, someone will chime in with the 
            all-too-familiar phrase: <em>"Keep politics out of running!"</em></p>
        <p><b>Let's be clear:</b></p>
        <p><em>Running is political.</em></p>

        <p>SPECIAL EFFECT: <br>These are inherently political questions. Pretending otherwise 
            is not neutrality - it is a choice to ignore the structures that create inclusion 
            for some and exclusion for others.</p>

        <p>Yes, I believe that the running community has the potential to be a powerful force 
            for positive change. A space where meaningful debate opens hearts and minds. Where 
            solidarity extends beyond the high five after a run, and where peaceful coexistence 
            of different backgrounds, beliefs, and identities is practiced every day. Running 
            together makes a statement. It proves that diversity is not a threat, but a strength.</p>

        <p>Now, more than ever, is the time to be loud and visible. To open this space for 
            debate and exchange. Silence is death.</p>
            
        <p>So speak your mind. State your values. Stand up to injustice whenever and 
            wherever you see it. And never let anyone tell you that there is no place 
            for political discourse in running. There is.</p>
